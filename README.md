# Description
On Track is an application designed for job seekers to track their job hunts. 
With On Track, job seekers are able to add all the jobs they've applied to, track and update the statuses of each application, and even delete the ones they've decided not to continue with! 

Furthermore, job seekers can see the overall totals for their applications, interviews, and rejections, and offers in real time! Once an offer has been accepted and the job hunt is over, On Track will save that search for you and display it on your home page for you to look back at!
